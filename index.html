<td>Holes in central spindle
Holes with chewed fibre sticking out in central spindle	Triangular cuts on leaves
The adult beetle bores into the unopened fronds and spathes
Damage by the pest leads to 10 to 15% loss in yield
The attacked frond when fully opened shows characteristic triangular cuts
Central spindle appears cut or toppled
Fully opened fronds showing characteristic diamond shaped cuttings
Holes with chewed fibre sticking out at the base of central spindle</td>

<td>Soak castor cake at 1 kg in 5 liter of water in small mud pots and keep them in the coconut gardens to attract and kill the adults
Remove and burn all dead coconut trees in the garden (which are likely to serve as breeding ground) to maintain good sanitation
Place phorate 10 G 5 g in perforated sachets in two inner most leaf axils for 2 times at 6 months intervals
Set up Rhino lure pheromone trap @ 5 traps/ha to trap and kill the beetles. The dispenser may be hanged in a plastic bucket having 2 liter of insecticide solution once in a week. Trapped beetles can be disposed off.</td>
